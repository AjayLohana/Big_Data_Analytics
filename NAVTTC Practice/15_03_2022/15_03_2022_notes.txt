points from previous lecture:

1. Data
2. Innovation of Data
3. Big Data (Collecting and organizing a huge amount of data)
4. Data Analysis (Analyzing the data from a collection of a huge amount of data)
5. Industry Revolution (Industry 5.0)
6. Increasing the rate of generation of data day by day
7. Usage of Data is Increasing
8. Data Mining (Extract usfull or meaningfull data from a huge amount of data)
9. social media (providing suggestions on the basis of our search history and our interests)


Probability and statistics
        1. Linear regression y=f(x) => uses linear function => good society, price good.
        2. Correlation
        3. Deviation
        4. Probabilistic methods
        5. Decission trees => used in Software developers domain => Total cost ko predict karnay k liay use hoti hai.


anomalies => something which is not obvious

        Data: Catagorical and Numerical data (Numerical data can be discrete or continuous)
                categorical => bar and pie plots
                numerical => histograms,line plot, scatter plots

        Measurement of data:
                Qualitative and Quantitative:
                1. Qualitative=> Nominal and Ordinal
                2. Quantitative=> Ordinal,Interval,Ratio

Library:
        1. Group of functions and modules.
        2. reusable functions (functions are that chunk of code that do a specific task)
        3. module is called the library.
        4. Matplotlib is the library of python used for visualization of the data
        5.
